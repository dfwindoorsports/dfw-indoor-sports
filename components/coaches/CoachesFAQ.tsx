                { q: "Can I request a specific coach for my child?", a: "Yes. While we assign coaches based on program level and scheduling, we accommodate coach preference requests when possible." },
                { q: "Do coaches work with complete beginners?", a: "Absolutely. Our coaches excel at introducing cricket to people who've never played, making the sport accessible and enjoyable for beginners." },
                { q: "What's the difference between group and private coaching?", a: "Group coaching (max 1:6) offers peer learning and affordability. Private coaching (1:1) offers maximum personalized attention and faster progression for specific technical needs." },
                { q: "How do coaches handle different skill levels in one group?", a: "Our coaches use differentiated instruction, providing appropriate challenges for each player within the group setting. Advanced players get complex drills; beginners work on fundamentals." },
                { q: "Can coaches help with cricket scholarships?", a: "Yes. For high school players, we provide guidance on US college cricket, skill development to competitive standards, and recruitment video assistance." }
