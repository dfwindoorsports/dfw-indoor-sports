We provide training cones/markers. Soccer balls available for purchase if needed." },
                { q: "Can outdoor cleats be worn on the turf?", a: "Indoor soccer shoes or turf trainers recommended. Traditional outdoor cleats with plastic studs acceptable, but metal studs prohibited (damage turf). Many players prefer indoor shoes for better feel on artificial surface." },
                { q: "How many players fit on one field?", a: "Depends on format. 5v5 (10 players), 6v6 (12 players), 7v7 (14 players). Maximum recommended: 16 players for training sessions (allows substitutions and drills)." },
                { q: "Can we host a tournament?", a: "Yes. We accommodate soccer tournaments and can provide full-day or multi-day field rental. Tournament packages include field time, referee coordination (if needed), and facility access. Contact events coordinator for custom tournament planning." },
                { q: "Do you provide referees for games?", a: "Referees provided for organized league matches (included in league registration). For private field rentals, referees available upon request for additional fee (additional fee). Most training sessions and pickup games self-referee." },
                { q: "What if we need to cancel our booking?", a: "24+ hours notice: full refund or credit. 12-24 hours: 50% credit. Less than 12 hours or no-show: payment forfeited. Weather never a cancellation reason (we're indoors)." },
                { q: "Can younger and older players play together?", a: "Yes, field rental allows mixed age groups. Many families rent fields for multi-generational play. Youth leagues and programs have age divisions for appropriate competition." },
                { q: "Is there a minimum rental time?", a: "One-hour minimum for field rental. No maximum - book as long as needed subject to availability. Most teams rent 1.5-2 hours for effective training sessions." },
                { q: "Do you host birthday parties?", a: "Yes. Soccer birthday parties popular for kids and adults. Packages include field time, basic equipment, party room access, and optional coaching/organization. Contact us for party pricing and packages." },
                { q: "Can individuals rent fields or only teams?", a: "Both. Individuals can rent fields for personal training. We also offer player-matching services helping individuals find pickup games and regular playing partners." },
                { q: "Are goalkeepers allowed?", a: "Yes. Full goals available for goalkeeper training and match play. Goalkeeper-specific training sessions can be arranged with coaching staff." },
                { q: "What's the ceiling height?", a: "Adequate clearance for soccer play including high balls and goal kicks. Ceiling doesn't interfere with normal gameplay." }
