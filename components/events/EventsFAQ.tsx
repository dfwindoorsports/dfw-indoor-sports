                  { q: "How far in advance should I book?", a: "For small events (birthdays), 2-4 weeks is sufficient. For large tournaments or corporate buyouts, we recommend 6-8 weeks to ensure availability. Popular dates (weekends) book quickly." },
                  { q: "What's included in event packages?", a: "Facility rental, equipment, professional facilitation/coaching, basic setup/cleanup, and party/meeting room access. Catering is optional." },
                  { q: "Can I bring my own food?", a: "Yes! All packages allow you to bring your own cake, food, and decor. We just ask no outside alcohol (adults can BYOB with coordination)." },
                  { q: "Do you provide staff?", a: "Absolutely. All birthday and corporate packages include professional coaching/facilitation to run the games and manage the timeline." },
                  { q: "Is the facility climate controlled?", a: "Yes. 100% climate controlled year-round. No rainouts, no heat exhaustion. Just perfect playing conditions." },
                  { q: "What is your cancellation policy?", a: "14+ days notice receives full refund minus deposit. 7-14 days receives 50% refund. We are flexible with rescheduling for emergencies." },
                  { q: "What sports are available?", a: "Cricket, Badminton, Soccer, and Dodgeball. You can choose one or combine multiple depending on your package." }
