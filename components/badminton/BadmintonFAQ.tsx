                { q: "What shoes should I wear?", a: "Non-marking court shoes are STRICTLY required to protect the professional floor and prevent injury (rolled ankles). Running shoes are discouraged." },
                { q: "Can complete beginners use the courts?", a: "Absolutely. Many members start with zero experience. We recommend combining rental with beginner coaching for fastest learning." },
                { q: "What is the difference between singles and doubles play?", a: "Both use the same court (44' x 20'), just different boundary lines. Both are playable on every court - lines are marked for both formats." },
                { q: "How many people can play on one court?", a: "Maximum 4 players playing at once. You can rotate in extra players, but we recommend booking a second court for groups larger than 6." },
                { q: "What if my reserved partner cancels?", a: "Court rental is for the time, not specific players. If your partner cancels, invite someone else or check our member group for a sub." }
