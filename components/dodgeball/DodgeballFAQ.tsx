                { q: "Is dodgeball safe? Does it hurt?", a: "Modern dodgeball is very safe. We use high-density foam balls (not the old rubber ones). They are soft enough to prevent injury and stinging, but firm enough to throw accurately. Rules prohibit headshots." },
                { q: "What should I wear?", a: "Athletic clothing and comfortable sneakers. You will be sprinting, stopping, and diving. No cleats allowed on the court." },
                { q: "Can very young kids play?", a: "We recommend ages 6+. Younger children may struggle with the mechanics and attention span. For mixed age parties, we adjust rules and ball sizes." },
                { q: "How many people do we need?", a: "Minimum 6 (3v3) for a fun game. Ideal is 10-16 players (5v5 to 8v8). The court can accommodate up to 24 players comfortably." },
                { q: "Do you provide referees?", a: "Yes. Staff are available to teach rules, facilitate games, and referee. This is included in birthday/corporate packages and available for an add-on fee for hourly rentals." },
                { q: "Can we bring our own balls?", a: "We provide all necessary equipment including balls of various sizes. You are welcome to bring your own foam balls if you have a specific preference, but rubber balls are not permitted." }
