                { q: "Is membership worth it if I only play once a week?", a: "Yes, especially for Badminton. 4 sessions a month drop-in is ~$150. Membership is $70-85. For cricket, you break even at about 3 hours of play per month." },
                { q: "Can I freeze my membership?", a: "We don't offer freezes, but monthly plans can be cancelled with 30-day notice. Half-yearly plans must complete their term." },
                { q: "Can I share my membership?", a: "No. Memberships are individual (except Family Gold). Sharing credentials carries a $250 fine. Use Guest Passes to bring friends!" },
                { q: "Do you offer student/senior discounts?", a: "Our rates are already highly discounted compared to drop-in. Students/Seniors benefit equally from unlimited access." },
                { q: "Is there a registration fee?", a: "Yes, a one-time $20 registration fee applies to all new memberships to cover administrative setup." },
                { q: "What if the facility is crowded?", a: "Members have priority booking rights (7-14 days in advance). We also cap total memberships to ensure reasonable access." }
