                { q: "Can I just walk in and play?", a: "Yes! We love drop-ins. However, evenings and weekends can get busy, so we highly recommend booking your slot online to guarantee your court time." },
                { q: "Do I need to be a member to use the facility?", a: "Not at all. You can rent courts or lanes by the hour as a guest. Membership is simply a great option if you find yourself playing more than twice a month." },
                { q: "What should I bring for my first visit?", a: "Just comfortable athletic wear and non-marking indoor shoes (to protect our courts!). We have rental rackets, bats, and balls available if you don't have your own gear yet." },
                { q: "Is the facility suitable for young children?", a: "Absolutely. We have specific youth programs for ages 6+, and our dodgeball and badminton courts are very popular with families. We can adjust net heights and provide lighter equipment." },
                { q: "Do you have leagues for beginners?", a: "Yes. We run 'recreational' divisions in all our sports specifically designed for people who are new to the game or just playing for fun/fitness." },
                { q: "Is the facility open year-round?", a: "Yes, 365 days a year. Our climate-controlled indoor environment means you can play comfortably whether it's 105°F or 20°F outside." },
