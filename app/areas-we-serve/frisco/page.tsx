        answer: 'From Frisco, expect approximately 40-50 minutes via TX-121 W (Sam Rayburn Tollway) to TX-114 W. Weekend mornings typically have lighter traffic and can be as quick as 35 minutes.',

        question: 'Is the drive from Frisco worth it?',
        answer: 'Many Frisco families think so! Our purpose-built facility offers amenities that local gyms can\'t match: programmable bowling machines for cricket, Olympic-spec badminton courts with proper 30+ ft ceiling height, and a dedicated indoor soccer field. The drive becomes routine after a few visits.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Do you have programs for Frisco youth?',
        answer: 'Yes! Our Youth Academy serves families from across the Metroplex. Saturday programs are especially popular with Frisco families who make it a weekend activity. Cricket and badminton training for ages 6+.',

    },
    {
        question: 'What are your membership options?',
        answer: 'Monthly memberships start at $70 for unlimited open play access. Family memberships are $150. For Frisco residents who visit even twice monthly, membership is more economical than drop-in rates.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I make a day trip from Frisco?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! Many Frisco families combine their visit with lunch at nearby Southlake Town Square or Trophy Club. Saturday mornings work great—arrive around 9 AM, play until noon, then enjoy the area.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I store my equipment at the facility?',
        answer: 'Yes, we offer equipment storage lockers for regular members. This is especially convenient for Frisco players who don\'t want to carry cricket gear on every trip. Ask about locker rental options.',
