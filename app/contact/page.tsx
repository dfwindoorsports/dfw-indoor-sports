    { question: "What if I need to reach you urgently?", answer: "Call (817) 938-0808. During business hours, staff answers directly. After hours, leave a detailed voicemail with your phone number and reason for urgency." },
    { question: "Can I visit without an appointment?", answer: "Yes, though facility tours are easier to accommodate when you call ahead. Drop-ins welcome during business hours." },
    { question: "I submitted the form but haven't heard back - what should I do?", answer: "Check your spam folder first. If nothing after 48 hours, call us at (817) 938-0808 - something may have gone wrong with the submission." }
